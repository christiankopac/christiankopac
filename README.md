### A little bit about me...

I'm always exploring new ways to combine the digital and physical worlds. Whether it's creating tools for productivity or crafting beautiful digital experiences, I'm driven by curiosity and a passion for learning. When I’m not coding or experimenting, you’ll find me reading, listening to audiobooks, or refining my org-mode workflow with Emacs.
